# Intialising

- npm init:

  package.json: ( this file is like a INDEX's role in book, its metadata associated with a project )

  src/app.js - starting point of your application, main code js file where you'll write nodej/js code

- npm i express

  dependencies: whenever we install/i something, it adds dependecy to our project inside "node_modules" means it added "express" as dependency to our project.
